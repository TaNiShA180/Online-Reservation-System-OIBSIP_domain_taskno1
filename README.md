## Objective

The Online Reservation System is designed to facilitate train ticket reservations for users. It provides a simple and efficient way for users to manage their travel plans through a console-based interface, allowing them to log in, make reservations, and cancel them as needed.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login system with username and password
- **Make Reservations**: Create new train reservations with complete journey details
- **Cancel Reservations**: Cancel existing reservations using PNR number
- **Session Management**: User logout functionality
- **Data Management**: In-memory storage for users and reservations

## Steps Performed

1. **User Management System**
   - Created a `User` class to handle user credentials (username and password)
   - Implemented user authentication mechanism

2. **Reservation Management System**
   - Developed a `Reservation` class to store reservation details:
     - PNR number
     - Train information (number and name)
     - Class type
     - Journey date
     - Travel route (from and to destinations)

3. **User Interface Development**
   - Implemented console-based user interface
   - Created menu-driven navigation system
   - Added input validation and error handling

4. **Data Storage Implementation**
   - Utilized `HashMap` for efficient data storage and retrieval
   - Implemented separate storage for users and reservations

## Tools Used

- **Java SE**: Primary programming language
- **Java Collections Framework**: `HashMap` for data storage
- **Scanner Class**: For reading user input from console
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes and objects for code organization

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
   - Any Java IDE or text editor

2. **Compilation**
   ```bash
   javac OnlineReservationSystem.java
